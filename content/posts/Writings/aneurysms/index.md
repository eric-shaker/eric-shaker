This project involves the development of a product meant to help pediatric patients with congenital heart defects. 

Today, thousands of children nation wide are suffering from congenital heart defects and unfortunately many die due to the stress of multiple heart surgeries. Children are one of the most at risk patient populations for CHD with the prevalence of babies being born with heart diseases is increasing.

Current heart valves developed for adults have been used on infants to treat CHDs, but the large devices sometimes require open heart surgery, presenting a severe risk to infants and young children. Often, these patients are already too weak or ill to undergo such major surgery. Additionally, infants and children grow quickly, but the artificial valve does not, resulting in repeated surgeries that increase risks.

Our project is a low-profile, self-expanding, biodegradable heart valve that will grow with the child for the effective treatment of congenital heart disease. Delivered by minimally invasive procedure, the device will pose significantly lower risks upon implantation. As the child grows, the superelastic nitinol and biodegradable metal coupling will degrade safely while naturally expanding with the surrounding anatomy.

Congenital heart disease disproportionality affects different races, contributing to the racial disparity in healthcare. And the financial burden of multiple surgeries often is too much for some parents, also contributing to the socioeconomic divisions in modern medicine. With our project, we aim to mitigate some of these differences in a disease that exacerbates racial divides while reducing the cost to equalize the financial playing field.

Below is a video submitted to the PinChe competition for innovation in healthcare.In it, we collaborate with fellow students and our PI to further describe the project, and mission we're trying to accomplish.
