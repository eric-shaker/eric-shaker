> ## THIS SECTION IS STILL UNDER CONSTRUCTION


Human spirit is driven by achievement. Our definition of achievement is inherently 
unique, from attaining a certain social status to finding financial freedom. It is that which we 
assign value to that we dedicate our lives in order to achieve. When in control of our own stories, 
this idea is a great vehicle for ambition and source of happiness. However, when our lives are put 
in the hands of others, our idea of success is liable to misinterpretation. In end of life care, 
physicians and loved ones are often thrust with the burden of enacting the beliefs of terminally ill 
patients. In these situations, decision makers often face an inability to shift perspective, a 
vulnerability that can bring grief and suffering to the patient and family. Understanding what the 
patient feels is a priority – the determinant of value – is invaluable to delivering the quality of 
care that patients deserve. To traverse this issue, we must investigate its origins in 18th century 
French medical society coupled with an understanding of contemporary idealism and rhetorical 
barriers. Fundamentally, we must ask how audience construction and objectivity can affect 
patient care and the perception of the elderly’s priorities. 
Integral to an understanding of current medical rhetoric, 18th century French society 
heavily influenced the trajectory and perspective regarding treatment. Outlined in The Birth of 
Shaker 2
the Clinic by Michel Foucault, early hospitals involved an intense and personal examination of 
the patient. As medicine became a vehicle for profit, namely through the betterment of treatment 
for the rich and improvement of the French military, it rapidly progressed. The funneling of 
money and resources into the field lead to the rapid technologization of medicine, and obsession 
with gaining information to improve medical knowledge. Ultimately, the focus shifted away 
from the patient, leading to a depersonalization of medicine (Foucault 85). In the same token, a 
fixation on new technology and advanced devices ingrained itself in current medical society, 
such that American physicians have earned the reputation that “if you throw enough money at [a 
case] you can fix it” (Marsh 216). This issue has exacerbated due to legislation and labor 
changes, in which a physician is ferried around seeing a myriad of patients without enough time 
to devote care to the individual, increasing the attractiveness of a quick and easy solution like 
new devices and pharmaceuticals. In essence, the origins of medical progress have cultivated a 
culture conducive to rapid, depersonalized treatment, ultimately to the misfortune of the patient. 
These issues have manifested themselves in an inability to shift perspective. Rushed 
patient interactions and the complexities of each individual force physicians to assume certain 
things about their patients. Physicians concede objectivity of a specific form – a judgment free of 
assumption necessary for proper scientific procedures as described by Stephen Gaukroger in 
Objectivity A Very Short Introduction (Gaukroger 5). This would not be an issue if physicians, 
loved ones and patients shared the same priorities. Unfortunately, these groups have increasingly 
different priorities, the divergence exacerbating with age and being especially harmful in end of 
life care.
Stanford psychologist Laura Carstensen investigated the difference in priorities of these 
three groups, producing a study that provides basis for the communicatory barrier between 
Shaker 3
patients and physicians. She found a substantial divergence in priority largely based on how 
much time subjects felt they had left, observing, “the youth tended towards goals that allowed 
them to achieve self-actualization: expanding networks, meeting new people and advancing 
skills while the elderly tended towards enjoying their time with those close to them now 
(Gawande 97). The inability to objectively think, free of assumption, leads physicians to 
automatically prioritize further, optimistic and risky advanced care while elderly patients are 
often satisfied in their current state and would prefer to enjoy their life with those they care 
about. The physician, in their current state, is bound to this narrative in the era of rapid and 
depersonalized care. A patient’s loved ones, another source for decision making in end of life 
care, often face similar issues regarding objectivity. Families can often be more selfish, unable to 
let go of their loved ones in dignity and willing to enact treatment plans to prolong this. Once 
again, judgment free of assumption and bias is lost as loved ones, overcome with their own 
emotions, forget the priorities of their patient. Decision making often invariably follows the 
universal trend that “we want autonomy for ourselves and safety for those we love” (Gawande 
106). As a result, loved ones in the decision making progress often prioritize treatment plans 
inconsistent with the wishes of the patient. 
This study and the acknowledgement of the origins of current medical culture naturally
force one to question the effect on medical rhetoric. The lack of objectivity causes the physician 
and family to construct an audience incongruent to the reality. They assume that the patient is 
typically willing to extend their life, that they are a fighter, that they want to look for any avenue 
for complete remediation. Often times, as shown in Carstensen’ s study, this is not the case and 
the elderly would often rather to spend time with their loved ones rather than be sucked of every
fiber of life from them. In this way, doctors practice audience construction, creating for 
Shaker 4
themselves a theoretical patient whose ideals align with their own. This ultimately creates a 
terministic screen between the patient and the physician. The terministic screen is a 
communicatory barrier, a set of inherent assumptions made that limits possible options. In the 
patient-physician relationship, there is the assumption that “of course you want to extend your 
life as long as possible, what treatments do you want to undergo?” This assumption, ingrained in 
the minds of doctors dealing with patients in end of life care, limits the patient to accepting a 
treatment plan and attempting to wage war against their disease to gain days in their life. 
Although it is impossible to shift the trend in priorities highlighted by Carstensen, 
significant progress can be made in end of life care if these differences are considered. First, 
objectivity can be returned to medicine with awareness of the divergence between patient and 
physician priorities. To dive deeper into the issue, Gawande preaches “trying to learn what’s 
most important to them under the circumstances – so that you can provide information and 
advice on the approach that gives them their best chance of achieving it” (Gawande 182). In this 
way, physicians and families alike can construct for themselves an audience where their rhetoric 
and ideals align with reality. Gawande, and Dr.Block, palliative care specialist, strongly 
encourage the need for a conversation with terminally ill patients outlining their priorities. 
Questions regarding what facets of life they value most highly elucidate what risks should be 
taken treatment. Simple questioning can degrade the terministic screen from beforehand, 
changing “of course you want to extend your life as long as possible, what treatments do you 
want to undergo?” to “what facets of your life do you hold most dearly and need to maintain for 
happiness?” Patients can implement treatment plans that prioritize their happiness and 
satisfaction when given these opportunities to speak and paired with a health professional that is 
invested in their correct application.

Through exploring whether audience construction and objectivity are capable of affecting 
patient care we arrive at the realization that end of life treatment suffers greatly from an inability 
to empathize. We find that this flaw is an amalgam of the history of medical culture and current
rapid, depersonalized medical treatment which compromises the ability to think objectively. 
These circumstances couple with universal divergences in the priorities of the young and old to 
create a growing issue in end of life care. To revert this issue, we must tear down the terministic 
screens that construct an audience incongruent to reality through facilitating discussions based on 
the values of the patient. Although a little grandchild might not understand the importance of 
seeing their grandfather for seemingly the hundredth time – he has not been jaded by life with his 
focuses narrowed and his priorities shifted. Our priorities are a derivative of our value system, 
our time being the variable by which we attach weight, its finitude demanding careful 
consideration and attention in our lives. This relationship is one that must be extended and 
considered amongst all, not just in disaster situations or as the sand of the hourglass falls for the 
last time.
